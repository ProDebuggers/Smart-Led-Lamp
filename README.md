# Smart-Led-Lamp
Electronics Product Design and Manufacture Project

Product Goals

The main aim of this project is to introduce an improvement to the existing household LED bulb 
in order to switch it on and off remotely using mobile phone without reaching the ordinary 
switch. This enables you to take control of the bulb while you are at work in the near area. It is 
expected to save energy by introducing a feature to change light intensity accordingly with 
environmental conditions.

Design Specifications

It is planned to use Bluetooth technology to communicate between bulb and the mobile phone. 
A rechargeable battery will be used to power the PCB and to power the LED in an external 
power failure. A mobile app will be developed to carry the control remotely.
